A pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 Virus Intra-Patient Evolution Reporting and Analysis.

## Instructions

To run VIPERA locally with the default configuration, you only need one line of code after
[installing Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
and [configuring the inputs and outputs](config/README.md#inputs-and-outputs):

```shell
snakemake --use-conda -c4  # runs VIPERA on 4 cores (reccomended)
```

Alternatively, you can use a simple script ([`run_default_VIPERA.sh`](run_default_VIPERA.sh))
that downloads the data from our study and performs the analysis in one step.

This Snakemake workflow can be also [executed in an HPC environment](config/README.md#run-modes).

Please refer to [config/README.md](config/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.
