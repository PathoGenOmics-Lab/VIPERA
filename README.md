A pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 Viral Intra-Patient Evolution Reporting and Analysis.

## First steps

To run VIPERA locally with the default configuration, you only need one line of code after
[installing Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html),
configuring [the inputs and outputs](config/README.md#inputs-and-outputs) and
[the context dataset](config/README.md#automated-construction-of-a-context-dataset):

```shell
snakemake --use-conda --cores 4  # command for Snakemake v7
```

We provide a simple script that downloads the [data](https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/15648) from [our study](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veae018)
and performs the analysis in a single step:

```shell
./run_default_VIPERA.sh
```

The workflow is compatible with both local execution and HPC environments utilizing SLURM.
The latter requires installing the [Snakemake executor plugin for SLURM](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/plugins/executor/slurm.html).
It supports dependency management through either conda or Singularity, as detailed in the
[run modes documentation](config/README.md#run-modes).

We use continuous integration (CI) to verify that all dependencies install correctly
with Snakemake v7.32.4 (see GitHub Action `Install`), and to test that VIPERA runs
successfully with Snakemake v7.32.4, v8.30.0, and v9.1.6 (see GitHub Actions
`Test Sm v[7-9]`).

Please refer to the [**full workflow documentation**](config/README.md) for detailed instructions.

  abstract = {Viral mutations within patients nurture the adaptive potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during chronic infections, which are a potential source of variants of concern. However, there is no integrated framework for the evolutionary analysis of intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 serial samples. Herein, we describe Viral Intra-Patient Evolution Reporting and Analysis (VIPERA), a new software that integrates the evaluation of the intra-patient ancestry of SARS-CoV-2 sequences with the analysis of evolutionary trajectories of serial sequences from the same viral infection. We have validated it using positive and negative control datasets and have successfully applied it to a new case, which revealed population dynamics and evidence of adaptive evolution.
